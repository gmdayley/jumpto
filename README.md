# JumpTo README

This is the README for your extension "testcreator". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Inspired by [Tim Pope's vim-projectionist](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist), this extension
creates and jumps to alternate files as configured.  This is useful for quickly creating test files
and jumping back and forth between the source code and the test code

Files can be created by templates and this extension has basic support for a lot of the transforms
currently available in projectionist.

The config for this extension uses a .projectionist file
